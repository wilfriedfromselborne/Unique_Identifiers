1. single errors:
abecomesb(60% to 95% of all errors)
2. omitting or adding a digit (10% to 20%)
3. adjacent transpositions:abbecomesba(10% to 20%)
4. twin errors:aabecomesbb(0.5% to 1.5%)
5. jump transpositions:acbbecomesbca(0.5% to 1.5%)
6. jump twin errors:acabecomesbcb(below 1%, lower for longer jumps)
7. phonetic errors:a0becomes1a, since the two have similar pronunciations in some languages, e.g.thirty and thirteen (0.5% to 1.5%)

A more detailed analysis and categorization of the sort of errors incurred when dealing with numbers wasreported by J. Verhoeff(Error Detecting Decimal Codes, Mathematical Centre Tract 29, 
The MathematicalCentre, Amsterdam, 1969) based on a study of 12000 errors:
